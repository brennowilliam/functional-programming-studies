Why FP?

Imperative vs Declarative

Imperative is code that focus on how to accomplish a task.

We have been moving more towards declarative programming (what should it happen) as we keep adding more to programming languages.

It is easier to understand declarative than imperative.

The more we focus on the WHAT instead of the HOW, the easier it becomes to someone read code later.

functional programming relies on provable theories that have been around for long time such as mathematical concepts.

** Code you cannot understand, it is code that you can't trust **

A functional programmer trust his code. He knows what's going to do. 

Increases code reliability. Make others have a easier time reading our code.
